      question: "How do I cancel my order?",
      answer: (
        <>
          You can cancel your order on the 'My Orders' page before it ships out.
          <br />
          <br />
          Note:
          <br />
          <br />
          1. We're not able to cancel an order that has been shipped. We
          recommend you do a return for a refund with our return label.
          <br />
          <br />
          2. If the items you purchased are from different warehouses at the
          same time, there are two orders generated. If the 3 orders are
          enjoying same promotion activity, the other order will be canceled
          together if you cancel one of it.

      id: 3,
      question: "Why is my order taking longer to process than normal?",
      answer:
        "Once your order has been paid for, the warehouse needs few days to process it. However, certain items within your order may require longer-than-normal processing times, which could result in a later shipping time on your overall order.",
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      question: "How can I add an item to my wishlist?",
      answer:
        "You can save an item to your 'Wishlist' by hitting the 'â™¡' button on the product details page.",
